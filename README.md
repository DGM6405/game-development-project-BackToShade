A Low Poly RPG game v1

At the very start of this project, I haven’t come up with some strong ideas, but I do have some original and rough imagination of my game. 

I really like RPG games, so I think it should be a sole/multi players RPG game. It should be made with low poly models so that I can focus on the game mechanisms instead of struggling with drawing and some sort of graphics issues. 

Because I don’t know how to insert images here so… imagine you are seeing the Portal Knights or Minecraft, and that would be what my game will look like. There are interactive environments, including trees, rivers, animals… 

I’m not sure if I should call it an open world game or if it will have quests, but definitely, there will be the main character, monsters, weapon system, and upgrade systems. 

It should have a narrative but it couldn’t be very strong since I didn’t plan to tell people a soft/touching story.

So the main thing I’m trying to figure out is the game’s objective. The rest questions are some techniques that I’ve never touched like spells (e.g. fireballs), monsters’ AI and so on.

So, overall my game is a low poly adventurous RPG game with an unclear objective.
